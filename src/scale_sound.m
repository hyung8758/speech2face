function output = scale_sound(varargin)
%SOUNDSC Autoscale and play vector as sound.
%   SOUNDSC(Y,...) is the same as SOUND(Y,...) except the data is
%   scaled so that the sound is played as loud as possible without
%   clipping.  The mean of the dynamic range of the data is set to
%   zero after the normalization.
%
%   soundsc(Y,...,SLIM) where SLIM = [LOW HIGH] linearly scales  values in
%   Y in the range [LOW, HIGH] to [-1, 1].  Values outside [LOW, HIGH] are
%   scaled beyond [-1, 1] and will be clipped when played back on a sound
%   device. By default, SLIM is [-MAX(ABS(Y)) MAX(ABS(Y))].
